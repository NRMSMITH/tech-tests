# Tech Tests

This repo is designed to give you space and techniques to help students practise tech tests ahead of starting to interview. You should do these in check-ins with the students towards the end of the course.

Ideally they should only take 20-30 minutes long.

You can choose whether they pseudo code, or you drive while they navigate.

Please do not share this repo with the students, as it should not be a replacement for katas.


## KATAS

### sumOfAll

## BEND

### reading-books-api
->

## FEND
